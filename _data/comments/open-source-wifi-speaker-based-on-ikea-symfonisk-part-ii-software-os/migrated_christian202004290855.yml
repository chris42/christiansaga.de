message: 'I used the Symfonisk for a few days before rebuilding it. The sound is somewhat comparable, however the speaker is louder than the original setting.
I might connect the old Sonos board back for a test and see what I can do. But I lack experience and equipment in frequency measurement. Thanks to you I now have a rough idea what to do. The good part with the software crossover is, that everyone can adjust it, as soon as there is more information.'
