message: 'If we use the watts, it is rumored, that most Sonos devices are around 30W. The Hifiberry has 60W, so I would guess that in this setup here is more powerful. But the loudness is only a small part and for me not important.
For most of it, I am very happy with the sound. Everything non bass related sounds really nice. Pushing the bass up in the equalizer, you get sort of a clanky sound. which I think is very much related to the lightweight chassis. But I am not expecting this small speaker to replace a sub woofer.


I am right now testing the rebuild with a Play:1, there it will be the complete opposite. Due to size, I have to reduce the amplifier with sadly only 5W. So far you feel the difference, but still enough to fill a room.'
