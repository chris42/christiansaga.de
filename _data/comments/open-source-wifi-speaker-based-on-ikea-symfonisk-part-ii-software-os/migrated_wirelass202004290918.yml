Wireless speakers like sonos and others, usually “sound big” on the bass department in relation for the size of the speaker, because the manufacturer “up” their bass digitally, however to protect the woofer from over-excursion and cracking noises, then they have to limit a bit of the overall volume.
Also they are built to tight budgets which is another limit for the quality of amplifier they use.
I wouldn’t be surprised if the amplifier that you used is more powerful!
